Our
Vision
Founded in 2019, we launched MillTech with the aim of democratising access to institutional-grade FX management. In an industry largely renowned for its lack of transparency and automation, we believe that we can help clients to navigate and advance their risk management through technology.
Our award-winning FX-as-a-Service solution, now supports over $500bn of client FX transactions annually and enables Investment Managers and Corporate Treasurers to increase their market access to liquidity providers, reduce their cost and risk profile, and automate manual workflows.
In 2025, we successfully expanded our product range to include Cash Management, and as we set our sights on the future, we continue to seek innovative ways of helping clients to achieve best execution and best practice on all their treasury related activities.
Our Heritage
Here at MillTech, we combine our deep currency investment heritage with a passion for technology advancement and problem solving. Born out of Millennium Global Investments, considered one of the founding firms in currency overlay, we have been at the forefront of developing the most cutting-edge products for clients globally since 1994.
Seen as a way of externalising the execution and governance infrastructure built to support over $20bn AuM from some of the largest institutions in the world, MillTech became the execution and technology arm of the Millennium Global group.

The truth behind the 5 biggest myths about TCA

Transaction Cost Analysis

Transaction Cost Analysis (TCA) plays a crucial role in modern FX risk management, offering insights into execution quality, cost efficiency, and overall performance. Whether you're a corporate treasurer or CFO at a fund manager, the ability to assess trade execution across a portfolio and identify cost-saving opportunities is invaluable.
Despite the obvious benefits, there are still a lot of misconceptions preventing CFOs and Treasurers from implementing TCA. In this article, we will dispel some of the top myths surrounding TCA.
In this article:
TCA is too expensive
My banking partner's TCA is independent
TCA is only about cost
TCA only needs to be done once
TCA is a waste of time
TCA is too expensive
Transaction Cost Analysis (TCA) is often perceived as too expensive, but in reality, it offers significant value that justifies its cost.
TCA provides firms with detailed insights into the true costs of their foreign exchange (FX) transactions, including hidden fees, poor execution timing, and uncompetitive spreads. By identifying these inefficiencies, firms can make more informed decisions and improve execution, ultimately saving money over time.
CFOs and treasurers often misunderstand the ROI of TCA. The long-term value of TCA, which is the potential savings and optimisation of FX execution, can be difficult to quantify upfront. This leads to a common misconception that the costs of TCA are too high compared to the immediate, visible benefits.
For example, even a small improvement in FX execution—such as better timing or a reduced spread—can translate into substantial savings, particularly for firms with high FX volumes. Over time, TCA helps reduce slippage and improve trade execution, potentially allowing firms to make a quick return on their initial investment.
There is a way to avoid these initial setup costs – by outsourcing your TCA. Outsourcing TCA is often more cost-effective than maintaining an in-house team. Independent providers offer specialised expertise and advanced tools, allowing businesses to focus on their core activities while still benefiting from high-quality TCA services. External providers, such as MillTech, offer a host of FX risk management products, with TCA built into this offering.
My banking partner’s TCA is independent
If firms wish to implement TCA into their workflow, they must first decide whether to conduct TCA in-house or independently, as there are key differences between the two. Banking partners often provide TCA as part of a relationship but is this really independent? It’s akin to a student marking their own homework.
Independent TCA provides an outsider’s perspective, ensuring that the analysis is free from internal biases or conflicts of interest. This impartiality is crucial when presenting data to external stakeholders, regulators or auditors. Moreover, independent providers specialise in TCA and are equipped with advanced analytical capabilities, ensuring that clients benefit from the most up-to-date technology and industry practices.
Independent TCA providers also have access to a broader range of market data and industry benchmarks, which enables them to conduct more comprehensive analysis. Their rigorous data validation and quality control processes help to optimise the reliability of the results, aiming togive clients confidence in the accuracy of the analysis. Additionally, many independent TCA providers adhere to regulatory standards, helping firms meet compliance requirements and reduce regulatory risks.
Independent TCA also serves as third-party verification, providing an added layer of transparency and accountability that is especially valuable during audits or external reviews and for maintaining stakeholder trust.
TCA is only about cost
You would be forgiven for thinking that TCA just covers costs, after all, it is called Transaction Cost Analysis. However, TCA in FX goes far beyond just simple cost analysis. While its primary function is to examine and reduce the direct costs of trading, TCA also plays a broader role in enhancing overall FX execution strategy, risk management, and transparency.
One of the key benefits of TCA is its ability to improve execution quality. By analysing the timing of trades, market conditions, and liquidity, TCA provides insights that help firms optimise when and how they execute transactions, leading to better pricing and reduced market impact. This strategic advantage can significantly enhance a firm’s FX operations.
Furthermore, TCA contributes to governance and compliance. In an increasingly regulated environment, firms need to demonstrate that their FX trading practices align with best execution policies. TCA provides the necessary data to validate that trades are being executed efficiently and in the best int

Despite businesses regularly transacting in FX, many have poor visibility on what the costs of these transactions are and suffer from hidden charges. These include costs hidden in the spread, better pricing for larger participants and an inability to compare the market, as covered in our
‘What are the hidden costs in FX?’
blog earlier in the series.
Recently though, there has been a steep change regarding the demand for pricing transparency in FX. As firms strive to increase efficiency, they are also trying to get to the bottom of their FX execution costs with the aim of saving money and demonstrating strong governance to internal stakeholders.
But what is the best way to get visibility on execution costs?
Achieving pricing transparency
TCA and its benefits
The answer is simple:
Transaction Cost Analysis (TCA)
.
TCA enables firms to understand how much they are being charged for the execution of their FX transactions.
An independent TCA will compare your executed price against the actual mid-market rate [MID]. It will also demonstrate the total trade slippage as a means of evidencing both explicit and implicit costs.
It goes hand in hand with best execution, serving as an ongoing audit of FX practices within a firm’s currency execution function as a demonstration of good governance.
A TCA does more than simply safeguard transparency. It allows for ongoing comparison of the quality of execution against the wider market and demonstrates Best Execution.
Ongoing, quarterly TCA from an
independent TCA
provider can be embedded as a new operational practice to ensure consistent FX execution performance.
Multi-bank marketplace with TCA embedded
Multi-bank marketplaces
, like MillTech, have TCA embedded and so provide independent transparency that’s historically only been available to the largest market participants.
They also go a step further. By providing access to a single interface with live rates from multiple banks, FX marketplaces enable asset managers and corporate treasurers to compare the market and execute at the best rate.
This is a step forward in innovation, as it seeks to increase transparency, streamline operations and save money.
Take the next step towards getting more transparency on your hidden FX execution costs.

In our opinion, access to competitive pricing and operational efficiency will always be critical factors for private equity firms when it comes to trading currencies. But for many firms, one particular concern has risen to the forefront: a lack of transparency.
Consider this scenario. A private equity firm wants to invest in an overseas technology business. It has several currency matters to consider:
1.
How to physically buy foreign currency (i.e. perform a spot FX trade)
2.
Whether to consider FX hedging at the portfolio level
3.
If hedging is required: how to minimize margin ( i.e. collateral) payments
In addition, regardless of the investment in this company, the private equity firm may have FX hedging needs at the share-class level to consider.
To check prices from two liquidity providers, it must phone both individually, ask for a quote, compare the two, then go back to the best one and place the trade (assuming the market hasn’t moved in the intervening period).
We speak to private equity firms set up like this all the time and there are a couple of problems with it in our view. It’s unlikely that the private equity firm has been able to
achieve best execution.
They simply don’t have
the operational set-up in place to access multi-bank best execution
strong enough pricing power to drive down their execution costs
little visibility on what their costs actually are
It's worth remembering that fund managers are fiduciaries. They are responsible for their investors' money, which brings with it the duty to put into place best practices for transparency.
The trouble is that FX has been notorious for its lack of transparency. This is thankfully now starting to change though.
The
FX Global Code
provides a global framework for good practice and processes around transparency, but many firms who are trading in FX not because they want to (i.e. speculating) but because they have to (i.e. hedging or simply buying foreign currency for a payment or investment), and are often not set up in a way that makes following the
FX Global Code
’s framework feasible.
So the question is: does implementing a solution that looks to provide transparent
best execution
always have to lead to an increased operational burden?
Achieving transparency without operational headache
MiFID II requires investment firms to take all "sufficient" steps to obtain the best possible result for the client. In addition, the FX Global Code applies principles for dealing with market participants in a consistent and appropriately transparent manner.
There are many factors to consider in achieving best execution; one of those is the best available FX exchange rate.
To get an order executed at the best available rate,
fund managers
commonly look to diversify their pool of FX liquidity providers. With multiple prices to choose from, private equity firms can then pick the best rate for them and demonstrate best execution.
However, the quest for best execution raises many questions:
How many FX counterparties do you need to achieve best execution?
What’s the best process for price discovery – should it involve multiple inputs from streaming rates, quotes in an e-mail, or calling around, as in our example of the private equity firm?
What’s the operational process involved, and does ease of use become a factor?
How should a private equity firm demonstrate best execution to its investors on an ongoing basis?
Before reviewing their current price discovery process, a fund manager must first understand how much they are being charged for executing their FX transactions.
Transaction Cost Analysis
(TCA) was explicitly created to provide transparency on these hidden costs: they are hidden because they are usually contained within the spread as opposed to being charged separately as an explicit cost. But the issue is many private equity firms still don't have access to this kind of analysis.
The goal of TCA might not just be to gain a competitive advantage when trading FX but potentially to comply with best execution policy that is reported back to partners and investors alike.
To perform
TCA
, historical trade data is required – currency pair, volume, timestamps and more. If a private equity firm is considering TCA to measure the quality of execution, they must first ensure they are collecting the necessary FX data from their counterparties. This should be fully transparent and broken down according to product, price, currency pair and include as accurate a timestamp as possible.
But how can this critical step towards transparency be achieved without introducing additional operational burden?
Use technology to stay ahead of the curve
The opaque nature of currency markets places great responsibility on private equity firms to put the processes, practi

Managing FX risk is like maintaining your car’s engine. You can skip the annual service and oil changes if everything seems fine, but eventually, a breakdown is inevitable. By the time the warning lights come on, the damage is already costly.
Just like with an engine, proactively managing FX risk keeps things running smoothly and prevents expensive, last-minute repairs. A well-thought-out FX risk management strategy is like traction control on a slippery surface, helping to maintain control and direction as market conditions shift. Without it, companies risk spinning out of control when currency volatility hits.
In this blog, we will delve into recent risk management trends and key strategies for managing FX risks in 2025. In an era of
heightened uncertainty
, the ability to steer through volatility isn’t just a nice-to have — it’s a necessity for survival and growth.
FX risk management strategies
FX risk management is a comprehensive strategy employed by businesses to protect their profitability and mitigate potential financial losses caused by adverse currency fluctuations. For corporations dealing with multiple currencies, inadequate FX risk management can significantly affect key financial metrics, such as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), ultimately compromising profitability and financial stability.
Corporate treasurers and CFO’s can manage FX risk effectively by leveraging a range of strategies, including financial hedging tools, to safeguard their financial positions against unfavourable exchange rate movements caused by currency volatility:
Hedging with forward contracts
Utilising options to limit downside risk
Employing currency swaps for flexibility
Minimising exposure through natural hedging
Consolidating transactions with netting and offsetting
Enhancing FX risk management through counterparty diversification
Hedging with forward contracts:
FX forwards are over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, which means they are traded directly between two liquidity partners and can therefore be customised around mutual requirements.
Currency forward contracts allow a business to buy or sell an agreed amount of an asset on a future date, at a price determined today. By locking in an exchange rate for the future, businesses can protect their bottom lines against currency volatility.
Utilising options to limit downside risk:
FX options are financial derivatives traded over-the-counter (OTC) or, less commonly, on exchanges. They grant the holder the right, but not the obligation, to exchange a specified amount of one currency for another at a predetermined exchange rate (strike price) on or before a specified expiration date, depending on the type of option.
FX option contracts allow businesses to mitigate downside risk while preserving some upside potential. These contracts often carry high premiums due to the option to exit the trade, which is not reimbursed if the trade is not settled.
Employing currency swaps for flexibility:
FX Swaps are Over-The-Counter (OTC) derivatives used by two counterparties to manage their currency exposures. In an FX Swap, the parties agree to swap a specified notional principal amount in one currency for an equivalent in another currency at the current spot rate. This setup enables the counterparties to hedge against currency risk by securing exchange rates for future transactions.
An FX Swap normally involves two transactions: an immediate exchange of currencies via a spot transaction followed by a reverse exchange using an forward transaction a later predetermined date.
Minimising exposure through natural hedging:
Natural hedging is a strategy businesses use to minimise financial risk by offsetting potential losses with corresponding gains. This approach involves aligning cash flows, assets, or liabilities in the same foreign currency to reduce exposure to exchange rate fluctuations.
Unlike financial hedging, which relies on external instruments like forward contracts or options, natural hedging is an internal risk management technique that does not involve additional costs or reliance on financial markets. By carefully managing operations, such as sourcing materials locally or matching foreign currency loans with international revenues, businesses can effectively reduce their exposure to exchange rate risks while maintaining operational efficiency.
Consolidating transactions with netting and offsetting:
Netting simplifies foreign exchange management by consolidating multiple currency transactions into fewer, streamlined transactions. This approach reduces complexity, helps to minimise costs, and is often used within businesses or between subsidiaries to manage and align FX exposures more effectively.
Offsetting takes a different approach to managing FX risk.

Over the years, outsourcing FX has emerged as a prominent trend in business operations, and this year has proven to be no exception. As UK CFOs have battled against
heightened currency volatility
and
uneven global economic growth
, with advanced economies
experiencing slowdowns.
A recent
YouGov study
revealed that 70% of British businesses are now turning to outsourcing solutions, this is backed up by our own survey in which all corporate respondents stated they outsourced FX processes in some capacity.
In this blog post, we will explore how businesses are outsourcing their FX to optimise operations and maintain a competitive edge:
Achieving operational flexibility
Drive efficiency and accelerate automation
FX risk management
Reducing operational costs without sacrificing quality
Outsourcing FX processes with MillTech
Achieving operational flexibility
FX is one of the
largest and most liquid
markets in the world, but also one of the most complex. Managing a variety of hedging instruments to counter market volatility, undergoing lengthy ISDA onboarding processes, and ensuring adherence to regulatory compliance, can be daunting for some businesses, especially those lacking the necessary infrastructure for effective FX operations.
In fact,
29% of UK corporates
have turned to outsourcing as it provides greater scalability and flexibility in operations. Outsourcing can provide the flexibility to scale FX services according to the business’s needs, without committing to long-term resource allocation. This scalability ensures that firms only pay for the services they require, optimising cost-effectiveness as their foreign exchange volume fluctuates.
Increased scalability can be realised by corporates gaining access to specialised expertise and advanced technology without the need to invest heavily in in-house capabilities. This can enable them to handle larger currency volumes and mitigate FX risks more effectively as they grow.
Drive efficiency and accelerate automation
In today’s highly competitive landscape, businesses that prioritise efficiency are often better equipped to adapt to changing markets. 26% of UK corporates delegate FX responsibilities to an external provider to increase efficiency, which typically includes overseeing the onboarding of new FX counterparties, centralising price discovery, and managing the post-execution phase.
Alongside the drive to increase efficiency, reducing manual tasks has become a key focus, with process automation emerging as a top priority in FX operations. Despite this, many businesses continue to rely on outdated technology for their in-house FX operations, with 42% of CFOs using phones as their main method for instructing FX transactions.
Additionally, fragmented service provision remains a challenge for 27% of corporates, with CFOs identifying it as one of their main FX hurdles.
By outsourcing FX operations to specialists, corporates can gain seamless access to real-time rates from a broad network of liquidity sources, all integrated into a single platform. This consolidation enables corporates to achieve best execution with improved transparency, frees up internal resources, and additionally ensures that regulatory governance requirements are met, providing assurance to key stakeholders.
FX risk management
Our findings indicate that 29% of UK corporates opt to outsource foreign exchange operations due of the complexities involved in risk management and compliance. Following episodes like the
forex rate-rigging scandal
in 2014, many market principles and regulations were introduced, such as the
FX Global Code of Conduct
and
MiFID II
, to avoid crises like this again. Whilst these may be overall beneficial to the ecosystem, these rules and regulations require a lot of work in order to be met.
In addition, significant market volatility and exchange rate fluctuations require sophisticated strategies to manage effectively. This often demands substantial resources, expertise, and technology, which can be especially challenging for small to medium-sized enterprises. Furthermore, the need to stay informed about geopolitical events and economic policies adds another layer of complexity, making it harder for businesses to plan long-term risk management strategies and predict future costs accurately.
Reducing operational costs without sacrificing quality
Across the UK, many individuals have felt the pinch of tighter budgets, and businesses are no exception. 70% of corporates reported an increase in the cost of hedging over the last year. In addition, a stagging 79% reported a recent increase in interest rates and fees from credit providers, noticed most by accountants and CFOs, with 88% reporting a spike within both roles.
Businesses are highly likely to be exploring various cost-cutting strateg

In our newest blog post, we are highlighting some of the costs associated with FX execution and hedging that fund managers should be aware of and rank them in order of transparency.
FX Execution Costs
Execution costs are often the first thing fund managers will reference when speaking about FX costs. Think of a bank as a currency wholesaler, who will then discount away from their wholesale rate to incorporate a profit margin or ‘spread’ when they quote their clients.
The spread will be impacted by various factors including, but not limited to:
how much a fund manager trades per annum
the size of a particular transaction
the liquidity of the currency pair
the tenor of a hedge
any other revenue generating products within the broader, holistic relationship with that fund manager
In theory, this cost should be easier to monitor and manage than all the other costs in this list. However, in practice, and even to this day, many fund managers cannot say explicitly what they are being charged.
One of the best ways for a fund manager to understand their current execution costs is by carrying out regular Transaction Cost Analysis (TCA) via an independent specialist. TCA is to FX execution what an audit is to annual accounts – third party analysis ensures that your FX counterparties are not ‘marking their own homework’.
Forward points
Forward points arise in certain FX risk management products such as forward contracts or FX swaps and are a universal market cost that is largely influenced by the interest rate differential between two currency jurisdictions.
Forward points can be negative or positive, and may be to the hedgers’ favour or detriment, depending on which currencies are being bought or sold.
Nothing can be done to avoid forward points, but fund managers should understand that the forward curve isn’t always linear.
The tenor of a hedge can be altered to take advantage of a non-linear forward curve in certain circumstances such as when the trade expiry date doesn’t need to match a pre-defined exit date.
Any spread that is incorporated into a forward rate, or the far-leg of a swap, can be monitored using TCA, in much the same way as other Over The Counter (OTC) FX products.
The Cost of Cash Drag
If you’re a fund manager who hedges FX risk using products such as swaps, forwards or non-deliverable forwards, then you may have experienced first-hand a hidden cost of hedging that isn’t often spoken about – the cash drag associated with placing margin.
When placing a hedge, a bank may request cash collateral (initial margin) to be held as security until the hedge matures and is settled.
Further, movements in the FX market may result in more collateral (variation margin) being requested, to cover the new mark-to-market of the hedge.
If a funds’ investible capital is held back for initial margin, variation margin, or contingent liquidity to cover potential variation margin requests at short notice, then deployed capital must work even harder to hit the target internal rate of return (IRR).
It’s almost impossible to know, with any degree of certainty, where FX markets will move and to forecast total margin requirements throughout the life of a hedge – this means, that on day 1, it’s impossible to forecast how placing margin will impact a funds’ investment returns.
For this reason, fund managers tend to seek out uncollateralized hedging facilities with each of their FX counterparties with a view to freeing up investible capital.
However, hedging on an uncollateralized basis might introduce additional costs that are built into the exchange rate in the form of a credit valuation adjustment (CVA).
Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA)
If a fund manager successfully negotiates uncollateralised hedging facilities with their counterparty banks, they should be mindful of the potential for additional FX charges when hedging.
Uncollateralised hedging means that the executing bank is taking additional risk on a client when they hedge.
After all, that bank has no security against that hedge and in the event of a client default the bank could potentially face a mark-to-market (MTM) loss. CVA is an adjustment in the FX rate to account for the possibility of default. CVA is not zero when FX hedges are collateralized, but it is heavily negated when compared to uncollateralised hedging.
CVA will vary from bank to bank, for different clients and might be influenced by prevailing market conditions. This means when a fund manager is executing a longer-dated trade that induces CVA, they can’t know exactly what their hedging costs will be in advance.
Although, generally speaking, as the tenor of a hedge increases, so does the potential mark-to-market loss and, therefore, the CVA charge.
In order to maintain FX transparency and

In today's economic landscape, UK businesses are grappling with a significant dilemma—how best to manage the financial risks associated with currency volatility.
With
higher borrowing costs
squeezing margins, businesses must weigh the advantages of hedging against the operational and financial challenges it presents.
A well-thought-out hedging strategy is like traction control on a slippery surface, helping to maintain control and direction as market conditions shift. Without it, businesses risk spinning out of control when volatility hits.
This blog explores these challenges and offers insights into how corporates can effectively safeguard their bottom lines:
Understanding the current hedging landscape
Benefits of hedging in a volatile market
High costs and credit constraints
Navigating the future of hedging
Outsourcing FX Functions
Understanding the current hedging landscape
Our revealed that hedging remains prevalent among UK corporates, with 76% of firms hedging their forecastable currency risk.
Interestingly, large businesses with over 500 employees are the least likely to hedge (68%), possibly due to their larger reserve capital, which cushions them from currency fluctuations. Conversely, smaller firms, which often lack such buffers, are more inclined to hedge.
In today's
volatile economic climate
, corporates are increasingly seeking stability, the mean hedge length has increased to 5.55 months, up from 3.78 months last year, indicating a growing desire among firms to secure longer-term certainty. Whilst the average hedge ratio remained stable at 45%.
Benefits of hedging in a volatile market
FX hedging is an effective risk management strategy for businesses exposed to foreign currency, helping to safeguard financial positions against adverse exchange rate fluctuations. Given current market conditions, 68% of UK corporates that don’t current hedge, are now considering this strategy.
Enhancing financial stability through forecasting
Hedging offers businesses the flexibility to plan ahead and safeguard their balance sheets against anticipated currency fluctuations. By improving forecasting accuracy, it provides greater predictability in financial planning.
It is therefore understandable that 53% of UK corporates are now planning to extend their hedge duration due to rising political tensions. By locking in exchange rates for future transactions, firms can improve budgeting with accurate cash flow estimates, enabling informed strategic decisions and leading to more stable financial results.
Variety of hedging instruments
With the various hedging instruments available, corporates have the flexibility to choose how to manage their currency risks.
Forward contracts, for instance, allow corporates to exchange two different currencies at a predetermined rate on a specific future date, with the rate being set at the start of the contract, providing certainty in costs and revenues despite market fluctuations.
On the other hand, option contracts offer more flexibility, giving businesses the right, but not the obligation, to exchange currency at a predetermined rate, which can be beneficial if market conditions change favourably, although they often come with pricey premiums.
Each hedging instrument has distinct features and requirements, allowing businesses to tailor their FX risk management strategies to suit specific needs and market conditions.
High costs and credit constraints
Increased cost of hedging
70% of UK corporates have reported an increase in the cost of FX hedging over the past year. Of those firms that don’t hedge their currency risk, 76% cited high costs as the primary deterrent.
This issue is particularly pronounced among smaller companies with 50-99 employees, with 85% experiencing rising hedging costs compared to 59% of larger firms with over 500 employees. This may be due to smaller companies having less negotiating power and fewer resources to manage financial risks effectively.
The increasing costs of hedging are not just affecting decision-makers; they directly influence corporate priorities. For 31% of UK corporates, reducing costs is a top priority, while 29% emphasise the need for cost transparency. These figures underscore the weight of FX costs on corporate strategies and how they can even discourage proactive risk management.
Stricter credit market
Concurrently, UK businesses are facing a tightening credit market. An overwhelming 74% of corporates report that credit providers have made it harder to access hedging in the last year. This trend has been most acute for accountants and CFOs, with 85% experiencing stricter lending criteria. Smaller companies are again at a disadvantage, with 87% reporting tougher credit conditions, compared to 59% of larger firms.
Additionally, 79% of corporates have noticed a ris

The recent woes of Silicon Valley Bank, Credit Suisse and First Republic Bank has brought counterparty diversity and due diligence back into the spotlight for many
fund managers
. When it comes to FX risk management, many fund managers are considering the best way to implement a more robust FX infrastructure and insulate themselves from future shocks.
The risks associated with limited FX counterparties
Lessons learned in the FX market
FX due diligence monitoring
The importance of counterparty diversity
Reducing direct counterparty risk
Barriers to having and maintaining multiple counterparty relationships
The solution
What are the risks?
Firstly, it’s important to frame what the risks to a fund manager are, should a banking counterparty no longer be able to function as their FX provider. There are obvious business continuity issues and if you are a fund manager who overlooks different share classes, invests overseas or converts management fees into foreign currencies - then you will not be able to perform these functions until you have a new facility open with a different FX counterparty.
Other risks to consider might include…
In-the-money FX hedges
– if a fund manager has open
FX forwards
with a failing counterparty and those positions have a positive mark-to-market (i.e. they make a profit if they were to be sold back into the market today at the prevailing spot rate), then the manager might be at risk from not realising that mark-to-market gain.
Loss of collateral
– if a fund manager has had to post collateral with their counterparty in order to book an FX forward, then that collateral may be at risk, in a similar way to cash deposits.
Not being able to maintain the FX hedge
– crucially, there is a risk that any pre-existing forward contract will not be honoured. If the purpose of that forward was to mitigate the effect of FX volatility on a portfolio of foreign currency assets, then fund level returns could be negatively impacted.
Lessons learned in the FX market
Spanish philosopher, George Santayana is famously quoted as saying “
Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
” which was ironically paraphrased and repeated by many other prominent historical figures.
The 2008 Global Financial Crisis is one event in recent history that brought to light many faults and failings in the banking world.
One key takeaway for any fund manager should have been - don’t put all your eggs in one basket when it comes to banking relationships.
Still, that’s not particularly helpful advice for a fund manager that isn’t currently well diversified and has overlooked this potential business risk.
As the dust settles on the recent turmoil in the banking market, fund managers can learn several lessons from this event and help ‘future proof’ their organisation should similar shocks reoccur.
FX due diligence & monitoring
Recent events underscore the importance of due diligence when selecting banking counterparties.
It is essential to thoroughly vet potential banking partners and assess their financial stability, risk management practices, and reputation before beginning a relationship.
Ongoing due diligence should be carried out regularly, until that relationship comes to an end, which might involve:
Daily monitoring of CDS levels and AML/compliance alerts.
Checking for updates from ratings agencies.
Regular communication with the front office at each bank and annual reviews.
It is vital to keep track of any changes in the financial stability of banking counterparties and adjust a panel of banks accordingly. By doing so, fund managers can help ensure they are partnering with financially stable banks that can provide reliable services.
The importance of counterparty diversity
Counterparty diversity is a pre-requisite for
FX best execution
and best execution should be a priority for any fiduciary firm. By having a panel of banks at their disposal, fund managers can ensure they have access to a variety of liquidity providers, which can improve the efficiency and execution of your trades.
However, for some fund managers, FX might be considered a non-core business activity meaning counterparty diversity may have been overlooked.
When it comes to foreign exchange trading, counterparty diversity means having relationships with
multiple banks
and not relying on just one to execute trades. In the context of recent events, this is important because if one bank were to fail, it could have serious consequences for your fund's trading activities, and potentially lead to significant losses.
Reducing direct counterparty risk
The ability to hedge foreign exchange risk without having to post collateral in the form of initial margin or variation margin offers numerous benefits to almost any type of investor.

Best execution
is one of the most commonly used terms across financial markets. Many believe that it just refers to pricing, but as recent events in the banking industry demonstrate, there are other important considerations that you shouldn’t take for granted.
When assessing the overall FX execution quality and execution governance in the context of best execution, it is important to consider a wide range of execution factors to determine the optimal execution arrangements that can help a firm achieve a best execution on a continuous basis.
Importance of pricing in FX
Counterparty Risk Assessment Framework
Execution contingency plan
Importance of pricing in FX
It is widely known that execution prices and costs are probably the most important execution factors in a normal market environment.
We believe firms should seek to achieve competitive execution prices and transparent cost structure. They can do this by adopting a
multi-bank FX execution platform
where multiple liquidity providers are competing to provide exchanges rates. This enables them to transparently compare and execute FX rates from multiple providers. The execution prices and costs can be accessed and monitored via an independent
Transaction Cost Analysis (TCA)
to demonstrate best execution.
FX counterparty Risk Assessment Framework
However, as the recent events with Silicon Valley Bank and Credit Suisse illustrate, other execution factors beyond pricing and costs can play a significant role.
For instance, the likelihood of settlement typically becomes the crucial execution factor when counterparty risk dominates the market.  As a result, selecting and performing appropriate due diligence on counterparties become an integral part of the best execution.
Firms should consider establishing a robust counterparty risk evaluation framework that considers of a range of risk factors, including:
Monitoring realised and unrealised profit and loss (P&L) for each counterparty
Credit rating from reputable rating agencies
Credit default swaps
Regular counterparty review and monitoring activities.
Execution contingency plan
In addition to reviewing and assessing the counterparty risks, the recent banking crisis events also highlight the importance of establishing a robust FX execution contingency plan that takes into account of legal and operational complexities.
If the counterparty becomes unavailable, the firm should be able to quickly and efficiently manage the existing FX trades by way of:
Novation - replacing an agreement in place with consent of all parties involved
Close-out - termination of the transaction
Implement Net Present Value (NPV) any future profits
Once existing trades have been managed, firms can then implement new FX trades as required by the business.

Institutional investors often face significant currency risk exposure due to overseas investors committing to their funds or growing their portfolio in foreign markets. Fluctuations in exchange rates can affect their investment returns, which can lead to significant financial losses. In order to manage these risks, many fund managers turn to FX hedging strategies to mitigate currency risk exposure by providing protection against unfavourable currency fluctuations.
This means that fund managers can better manage their investment risks and achieve
more stable returns.
In addition, by hedging their currency risk exposure, fund managers can focus on their core investment strategies, rather than worrying about currency fluctuations.
The ability to hedge foreign exchange risk without having to post collateral in the form of initial margin or variation margin offers numerous benefits to almost any type of investor.
Reduced Cost
If you’re a fund manager who hedges FX risk using products such as swaps, forwards or non-deliverable forwards, then you may have experienced first-hand a hidden cost of hedging that isn’t often spoken about. It’s not hidden execution spreads, service fees, forward points or even payment fees – the hidden cost is the cash drag associated with placing margin.
If a funds’ expected returns are 8%, then an investment of $100m should yield $108m. If 10% of investible capital is held back for margin or contingent liquidity, then the remaining $90m must generate a return of 20% to get to the same figure!
Without an unmargined FX facility, a fund manager must deposit collateral in order to enter into an FX hedge. This can be a significant amount, especially for larger trades.
Investor capital does not come cheap and if a fund manager isn’t fully invested, then deployed capital must work even harder to hit the target returns of drawn capital.
No margin hedging allows fund managers to remain fully invested while mitigating their FX risk.
Lower Risk
If FX hedging is margined, then a fund manager isn’t necessarily reducing risk – they may just be replacing one risk with another. Sure, FX volatility is no longer a concern, but finding liquidity at short notice to settle margin calls is.
Over time, a fund manager might have to add more collateral to cover a growing mark-to-market position which can be costly and stressful. If the fund manager runs out of free cashflow, they might have to liquidate positions at unfavourable prices and for illiquid strategies, this isn’t a viable option at short notice.
With no margin hedging, fund managers can better forecast future cash flows as they are not at risk of daily margin calls. They can therefore focus on the core task at hand, maximising returns.
What is Stopping Fund Managers Accessing No-Margin Hedging?
So, if no margin FX hedging is such a no brainer for many fund managers, what’s stopping them from accessing it?
Surveying the market
In our recent MillTech survey of 250 senior finance decision makers at fund managers,
34% stated that securing credit lines was their biggest challenge when dealing with FX
. It found that for 88% of fund managers, it took between 6 months and 1 year to setup their current FX infrastructure.
The first step in securing an uncollateralised hedging facility is successfully navigating the banking marketplace to find suitable partners. Different banks have differing levels of appetite for unmargined FX facilities, so it can be a daunting task knowing which bank to approach first.
Fund managers typically run lean operations and time is a scarce resource, meaning researching the market and pro-actively finding banks who will offer no margin hedging is challenging.
Even after a suitable counterparty has been engaged, the approval process for any type of credit facility can take time, and the outcome is not a foregone conclusion. This means a large amount of time and resources can be invested by a fund manager upfront and they don’t necessarily get the desired result of a no margin facility.
What about Best Execution?
Our research showed that
42.8% of fund managers said that demonstrating best execution was the most challenging aspect of their FX operation
. For a fund manager, satisfying best execution means having multiple FX counterparties at your disposal every time you trade.
Any fiduciary firm should consider best execution as a core component of best practice and not simply a regulatory obligation to satisfy. Pursuing best execution has other positive impacts too, notably the reduced transaction costs as a result of increased competition between counterparties.
Finding a bank that offers no-margin hedging and subsequently getting the FX facility approved and opened over the following months can be challenging enough - find

As the old adage goes: in calm water, every ship has a good captain.
The currency markets may have been going through a period of relatively low volatility in recent times, but with interest rate rises on the horizon, CFOs at corporates must not get lured into a false sense of security.
For many, currency management remains a huge and costly problem.
The challenge of managing currency risk
Throughout 2021, corporates had to adjust their priorities rapidly to reflect the changing economic environment in which their firms operated.
Navigating FX risk has been challenging for a variety of reasons. PwC’s recent
Global Treasury Survey 2021
found that inaccurate forecasting and poor visibility were some of the biggest challenges facing treasury teams.
This made the task of FX risk management like hitting a fast-moving target.
This was compounded by the supply chain crisis and CFOs having to quickly adjust against a backdrop of working from home due to lockdown restrictions.
Unfortunately, many clearly don’t think they have the best possible solution in place, with
only 23%
viewing their treasury as “best in class” in this area.
Many corporates believe they are continually getting a bad deal from the FX markets.
They have had no choice but to suffer the double whammy of significantly overpaying for their currency execution and hedging requirements and the operational agony of implementing and managing multiple relationships to seek (though often in vain)
best execution
.
Optimising FX risk management infrastructure
With economic changes, such as further interest rates on the horizon, here are four ways that CFOs can improve their FX risk management infrastructure, deliver sustainable growth and, ultimately, protect their firm’s bottom line:
1- Transaction Cost Analysis (TCA)
To effectively manage and hedge FX exposures, it’s important to first measure the cost and quality of your execution and to get a view on these hidden costs.
Transaction Cost Analysis
(TCA) was specifically created to highlight hidden costs and enables firms to understand how much they are being charged for the execution of their FX transactions. It goes hand in hand with best execution, serving as an ongoing audit of FX practices.
TCA can enable firms to gain a competitive advantage when trading FX but also potentially to comply with a best execution policy that is reported back to shareholders.
Ongoing, quarterly TCA from an independent TCA provider can be embedded as a new operational practice to ensure consistent FX execution performance.
2- Compare the market
Having the ability to put trades up for competition is typically central to ensuring access to the best price – which is key to effective hedging.
But many treasurers can be hampered by the inability to access tier 1 FX liquidity and the best institutional-grade execution terms, meaning they are often reliant on a single custody bank or broker to meet their execution and hedging requirements.
Fortunately, there is a new generation of fintech companies emerging that enable corporate treasurers to access a
single interface
to access live rates from multiple banks and execute at the best rate, all whilst reducing the operational burden traditionally associated with this kind of market access.
3- Margin-free hedging
Corporates who hedge, using forward contracts for example, must also consider that placing a hedge typically requires margin to be posted against that position as collateral. Further, if the initial margin no longer covers the mark-to-market of a hedge, due to movements in the spot rate, the corporate may be required to post additional, variation margin.
Any capital posted as collateral is effectively sitting dormant in a margin account and not available as working capital. The FX risk, mitigated with forward contracts, has been replaced with a potential liquidity risk.
One way around this issue is to trade via an uncollateralised FX facility so that a CFO can hedge using forwards and not worry about posting margin. Some
solutions
crucially offer this service without jeopardising best execution, ensuring total cost transparency.
4- Outsourcing
We have seen a rise in the
outsourcing of specific FX functions
, mainly those that are deemed ‘non-core’ to improve efficiency and achieve best execution. This is evidenced by the fact that 44% of CFOs in larger companies [1] have outsourced some of their day-to-day functions due to increased processes automation and/or digitisation, according to
HSBC and Acuris
.
Research published by the investment consultant Russell Investments
“Still Overpaying for FX”
concluded that for an average $1 billion fund, savings of $330,000 per annum would have been achievable from the adoption of an agency approac

It’s a challenging time for North American businesses. From
currency fluctuations
to
trade disruptions
, the landscape is evolving rapidly—and often unpredictably. For years, FX risk was seen as a background issue, quietly managed by treasury teams while the rest of the business focused on more pressing priorities.
But that's changing.
Corporates across North America are quickly realising they can no longer afford to be passive as unhedged FX exposure erodes profits. In this blog, we’ll explore the key differences in how Canada and US firms are managing the FX risk that threatens their bottom lines, based on our
2025 North America Corporate FX Report
.
Quick insights:
Canada demonstrates greater commitment to FX hedging:
97% of Canadian firms hedge FX exposure compared to 88% in the US, often using higher hedge ratios and longer tenors.
Tariff pressures prompt operational shifts:
96% of Canadian firms have adjusted operations in response to tariffs vs. 83% in the US—despite being more heavily impacted.
Regional FX challenges vary:
US firms struggle with fragmented service provision (38%), while Canadian firms focus on demonstrating best execution (36%).
Differing reason for outsourcing:
40% of Canadian firms are outsourcing FX functions to access specialised expertise, while 30% of US firms are outsourcing to enhance scalability and operational flexibility.
AI adoption gains momentum:
46% of US firms are exploring AI for process automation, while 44% of Canadian firms are considering its use specifically for FX operations.
In this blog:
How are Canadian firms leading the way with FX risk management?
How have tariffs impacted business in Canada and the US?
What's driving the FX strategy divide between the US and Canada?
Are automation and AI the future of corporate FX strategy?
How are Canadian firms leading the way with FX risk management?
FX risk management is rapidly moving up the corporate agenda across both Canada and the US. Yet it's Canadian businesses that are taking the lead, embracing a more strategic and forward-thinking approach to navigating currency volatility.
But how exactly do their strategies differ from those of their US counterparts?
Higher hedging activity
97%
of firms in Canada are hedging their FX exposure, compared to
88%
in the US, highlighting a stronger focus on protecting their bottom lines against currency volatility.
More aggressive hedging
On average, Canadian firms hedge
57%
of their currency exposure, significantly higher than the
47%
hedged by US businesses.
Longer hedging tenors
Canadian corporates are not only extending hedging tenors more frequently (
71% vs. 61%)
but are also hedging for longer periods on average—
13
months compared to
4.81
months in the US. This indicates a strategic focus on long-term stability versus short-term speculation.
Increased hedge ratios
Canadian firms are boosting their hedge ratios more frequently (
36% vs. 31%)
whilst US firms are more likely to reduce their hedge ratios
(37% vs. 25%
), a decision that may leave them more exposed to market fluctuations.
Whether it’s through
raising hedge ratios
,
extending tenors
, or
covering a greater share of their FX exposure
, Canadian corporates are taking decisive steps to shield themselves from currency volatility and build stronger financial resilience. For
US corporates
, this presents a timely opportunity to
reassess existing hedging strategies
and adopt a more
proactive, forward-looking approach
, to stay competitive in an increasingly unpredictable FX landscape.
How have tariffs impacted business in Canada and the US?
Tariffs have emerged as a disruptive economic force in 2025
,
dominating headlines and fuelling volatility
across global markets. President Trump’s assertive
trade actions
began with targeted measures on Chinese goods, quickly expanding to include imports from Canada and Mexico. The market’s response was swift and severe—on March 10, the S&P 500 dropped
2.7%
, wiping out nearly $4 trillion in value in a single day.
As one of the earliest targets of these new tariffs, it’s no surprise that
businesses in Canada are feeling the impact more acutely
than their US counterparts. Here’s a closer look at how tariffs are affecting Canadian firms compared to those south of the border:
Profitability & competitiveness
71%
of businesses in Canada say tariffs have significantly hindered their profitability or global competitiveness, compared to
69%
in the US
Hedging strategies
Canadian firms plan to increase hedge ratios and durations in response to tariffs, compared to US firms.
Currency risk concerns
In Canada,
43%
of firms cite both policy-driven currency fluctuations and unpredictable market movements as their top concerns.
US firms, on the other hand, adopt a more cautious appr

In an increasingly volatile global economy, managing currency risk has become a top priority for businesses worldwide. As exchange rates fluctuate and financial pressures mount, firms are turning to FX hedging strategies to safeguard their bottom lines.
This blog explores the key trends shaping corporate FX hedging in 2025, including the growing adoption of hedging practices and the impact of local currency movements on corporate decision-making.
Hedging is crucial for tackling currency risk
Why is hedging becoming more important for businesses?
As financial uncertainty grows, an increasing number of businesses worldwide are taking proactive steps to protect themselves. In fact,
81%
of companies across Europe, North America, and the UK
are now actively hedging their currency exposure.
Leading the charge is Europe, where a remarkable
86%
of corporates are now hedging their FX risk—
a dramatic rise from just
67%
in 2023.
This surge is likely driven by a combination of tangible market forces: rate differentials and sustained dollar strength have created persistent volatility, making it increasingly important for corporates to manage their FX exposure.
What are the consequences of not hedging currency exposure?
As market conditions continue to shift,
52%
of businesses globally that don’t currently hedge their currency exposure are now reconsidering their approach. UK corporates are at the forefront this rethink, with
68%
exploring new hedging strategies. What’s prompting the change? Most likely the financial consequences of inaction: three in four businesses worldwide have recently reported losses due to unhedged FX risk—underscoring the urgent need for more proactive and robust currency risk management.
A cohesive approach to hedging strategies
How consistent are hedging strategies globally?
Corporate hedging strategies are demonstrating notable consistency across the globe. The average global hedge ratio is
48%,
reflecting a broad alignment in hedging practices. Here's a closer look at how different regions compare:
North America and Europe:
Both regions report hedge ratios of
49%
.
UK Corporates:
Slightly lower at
45%
.
When it comes to hedge duration, the variation is minimal, which further points to a uniform approach in managing currency risks:
Global average hedge duration:
5.3
months.
UK Corporates:
Leads with an average hedge duration of
5.5
months.
What do longer hedge tenors and consistent hedging strategies indicate?
Longer hedge tenors typically indicate that firms are aiming to secure protection over an extended period, likely reflecting their efforts to gain stability amid a turbulent year for the pound. The limited variation observed in hedging strategies suggests that corporates globally are responding in a broadly uniform manner, adopting consistent risk management approaches as they navigate shared global uncertainties.
How are domestic currency movements impacting businesses?
Domestic currency movements are having a pronounced impact on corporates bottom lines, with
88%
of firms globally reporting effects. North American firms have borne the brunt, with
92%
citing challenges tied to a stronger U.S. dollar.
How have trade tariffs affected currency movements?
Tariffs imposed by the the Trump administration
, alongside
retaliatory levies
from global trade partners, have added pressure to markets. These developments have disrupted markets and raised the cost of cross-border trade for both large and small economies. Interestingly, in the immediate aftermath of U.S. tariff announcements,
the dollar has shown unexpected weakness
—suggesting that the financial repercussions may initially be felt domestically before reverberating abroad.
How have the euro and pound movements affected firms?
Meanwhile, in Europe,
88%
of corporates reported being affected by euro volatility. Similarly, in the UK, of firms felt the impact of a strengthening pound. However, there’s a notable difference in the consequences:
42%
of UK firms experienced negative consequences from pound appreciation.
In comparison, only
28%
of European firms were negatively impacted by euro movements.
Tighter lending criteria and heightened FX costs
How is access to credit affecting corporates?
Access to credit has emerged as one of the top concerns for corporates worldwide:
In North America
, 31%
of corporates identified credit access as their primary challenge.
In the UK,
74%
reported greater difficulty securing credit, while
79%
noted an increase in fees from credit providers.
“Tighter lending criteria is a common feature of turbulent economic times. If the average corporate earnings take a downturn, then lenders perceive a higher risk of defaulting on loans. This causes them to allow only the most creditworthy companies to borrow, particularly

If you are the CFO, COO, FD, FC or
Treasurer
at a
fund manager
, there is an increasing likelihood that at some point in your career you will encounter foreign exchange (FX).
The FX exposure might arise from share class hedging for overseas investors, acquiring foreign currency assets, a currency mismatch between management fee income and expenditure or an indirect exposure at a portfolio company.
Whether it is an occasional FX spot transaction, a rolling hedge program or a highly bespoke solution, fund managers with foreign exchange exposure not only have to navigate the sometimes complex and volatile world of foreign currency trading, but also decide what organization to partner with to help them go about it.
In the noisy marketplace of FX execution, a fund manager has a long list of potential counterparties, advisors and electronic trading platforms available to them, so it can be confusing to know the best way forward.
As dry powder and investment activity start to pick up in a post-pandemic World, we have highlighted what we believe every fund manager should consider before choosing an FX partner.
Best Execution and Price Discovery
Best execution
has been in the spotlight for some time. MiFID II regulation requires investment firms take all "sufficient" steps to obtain the best possible result for the client on an on-going basis. Further, the FX Global Code of Conduct applied principles for dealing with market participants in a consistent and appropriately transparent manner. There are many factors to take into consideration in the quest for best execution and one of those is price, or in FX markets, the best available exchange rate.
Long before MiFID II, a fund manager with only one FX counterparty at their disposal might have used FX spot mid-rates to apply some ‘price tension’. The difference between the price quoted to them and the mid-rate online could help to determine the spread (A.K.A. the fee) charged by their counterparty, and the General Partner (“GP”) could then assess whether the cost is ‘fair’ in exchange for the service they receive. However, price tension does not give way to best execution and best execution is simply not possible with a single counterparty.
Streaming online rates are only indicative and thus unlikely to be tradeable at that moment in time for the GP’s exact trade nominal. There are many factors that can affect the quoted FX rate; trade size, liquidity of the currency pair, market conditions, credit charges, delays from using non-electronic execution routes, and forward points, among others. FX execution should be a partnership in understanding and then applying an optimal way of executing each client’s business for the ‘best possible outcome’, whether this is utilising benchmark execution or other methods, and a lack of transparency can leave the fund manager in the position of being none the wiser whether what they are getting is a competitive rate or not.
For this reason, to get an order executed at the most advantageous rate, fund managers commonly look to diversify their pool of FX counterparties. That way, with multiple prices to choose from, GPs can pick the rate that is best for them, hence best execution.
However, the quest for best execution raises many questions. How many FX counterparties do you need to achieve best execution? Is best execution just about the best FX rate or are there other considerations? What’s the best process for price discovery – should it involve multiple inputs from streaming rates, quotes in an e-mail, calling around? What’s the operational process involved and does ease of use become a factor? How should a GP demonstrate best execution to their investors on an ongoing basis?
Ongoing, Independent TCA
Before reviewing their current price discovery process, a fund manager must first understand how much they are being charged for the execution of their FX transactions.
Transaction Cost Analysis (
TCA
) goes hand-in-hand with best execution and can be used as an ongoing audit of FX practices as well as to hold existing FX counterparties accountable. The goal of TCA might not just be to gain a competitive advantage when trading FX but potentially to comply with a best execution policy that is reported back to partners and investors alike.
To perform a TCA, historical trade data is required – currency pair, volume, product (spot, forward etc) and time stamps. To calculate the transaction cost on a trade, the actual rate the trade was executed at is compared to the independent mid-market rate at the point in time of execution. This difference multiplied by the trade notional equals the execution cost on that trade. A fund manager might consider using an
independent TCA
provider that can assess the pe

What’s stopping fund managers from accessing FX best execution?
With all the controversy and regulatory intervention relating to FX
best execution
in recent years, fund managers know what is required of them – so, what’s stopping them?
The short answer, in our opinion, is that it's labour intensive and difficult. Fund managers may need to identify and approach new FX counterparties, form new relationships, put ISDAs in place and set up new trading systems – It can be exhausting! The whole process, from start to finish, could take anything up to a year (in some cases longer) which can be time consuming, especially when FX might not be a core business operation.
The fun doesn’t stop there. Let's say a
fund manager
has gone through all the necessary steps and now has a multi-bank panel at their disposal for FX execution. Each counterparty might have different trade processes and systems to navigate – for this reason the fund manager might have to make an additional investment in an aggregator platform to centralise price discovery.
After all that, the fund manager might not see a fully transparent breakdown of FX transaction costs and may need to perform
transaction cost analysis
(TCA) through an independent TCA provider to evidence best execution - this too can come with its own costs.
Wouldn’t it be nice if there was an end-to-end
multi-bank solution
that evidences best execution and provides full cost transparency?
First, let's take a step back to understand FX best execution and why it is often in the spotlight.
What is best execution?
There are many factors to take into consideration in the quest for
FX best execution
:
Price and cost
Speed and likelihood of execution and settlement
Size and other factors directly related to the execution of the order
Often price or cost will be considered the highest priority, although for these to be the primary focus, there needs to be an operational robustness in all other components, such as settlement and speed.
Furthermore, considering the foreign exchange market is the largest and most liquid financial market in the world, it would be a fair assumption that transparency and best execution would come as standard, however, we believe this is not the case and some fund managers are still catching up.
How it’s regulated and why it matters
Best execution
is covered by various market principles and regulation originating from the FCA Conducts of Business Sourcebook and Principles of Business, the FX Global Code of Conduct and, most notably, MiFID II.
Combined, they stipulate that investment firms should:
Treat customers fairly
Deal with market participants in a consistent and appropriately transparent manner
Take all ‘sufficient’ steps to obtain the best possible result for the client when executing orders.
However, any fiduciary firm should consider best execution as a core component of best practice and not simply a regulatory obligation to satisfy.
Increasingly, investors are also questioning fund managers around their FX execution policy and requesting ongoing transaction cost analysis. Pursuing best execution has other positive impacts too, notably the reduced transaction costs as a result of increased competition between counterparties.
A history of controversy
Since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, the FX market has had its fair share of negative press. The forex rate-rigging scandal grabbed the major headlines in 2014 and significant fines were handed down to some of the world’s largest banks. However, in the background, stories relating to a lack of transparency and poor FX execution practices were rife.
In the US, a series of high-profile lawsuits were filed by pension funds against their custody banks, claiming that the banks had charged excessive fees for FX trades, deriving from a lack of transparency around how, and when, trades were being executed.
One such lawsuit alleged that for more than a decade the custodian in question had conducted FX transactions in “an unfair and deceptive” way to maximise its profits at the expense of its customers.
[i]
Closer to home, in 2014 the FCA published a press release titled ‘FCA finds firms unable to deliver best execution’. The article looked at 36 firms, finding that many “do not understand key elements of the rules and are not adequately controlling client costs when executing orders.”
[ii]
In 2017, the FCA highlighted that investment managers had not been particularly engaged with assuring best execution for their clients.
According to the FCA, some firms had been addressing the issue and are showing “good practice”, however the bulk of the industry is trailing behind.

Is outsourcing the answer?

With over 80 countries heading to the polls this year, businesses may be facing uncertainty on the impact geopolitics will have on their forex trading.
In times of adversity, businesses come under increased pressure and the lessons learned in stormy seas will often sharpen the focus on how a company’s finance function could evolve during calmer waters.
Taking into account the recent treasury reports published we take a look at how choosing the right FX partner can help achieve what many CFOs consider their key strategic priorities.
In this blog:
Hedging FX risk
FX financial risk management
Automation, digitisation and outsourcing FX
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)
Forming the right relationships
Hedging FX risk
If the past 5 years have taught us anything, it is to plan for improbable outcomes. Geopolitical events, like the upcoming elections or severe market shocks, like the pandemic, can have a huge impact on currency markets. If a business finds itself on the wrong side of an FX market move whilst unhedged, it can lead to significant losses.
Despite that, when it comes to currency markets, some CFOs still adopt a wait and see approach and try to hold out covering their FX requirement until market conditions are more favourable.
Our recent Corporate CFO research revealed that only 67% of EU corporates hedging their forecastable currency risk, compared to 70 in the UK and 81 in the US.
[i]
[iii]
Forecasting and visibility has undoubtedly impacted many businesses ability to hedge accurately, but CFOs should aim to ensure they are managing known risks when they can, and do away with opportunistic hedging so bottom lines aren’t left exposed to FX market volatility.
FX financial risk management
In tough times liquidity is precious, whether that’s a company's own funds or maintaining sufficient headroom on working capital facilities. Cash and liquidity management are one of the biggest challenges faced by corporate treasurers today.
[ii]
Businesses should explore ways to eliminate unforeseen demands on free cash flow, and one such demand might arise from financial risk management.
For example,  corporates may have to post collateral against FX hedges in the form of initial or variation margin. After posting cash collateral with an FX counterparty this capital is essentially dormant; it isn’t earning a return for the company and can’t be accessed at times when they might need it most.
CFOs should explore hedging solutions that are
margin free
and don’t pose a threat to free cashflow.
Automation, digitisation and outsourcing FX
Greater operational scale and complexity of a business is amongst one of the top three challenges faced by corporate treasurers today.
Against the backdrop of many businesses adopting a hybrid-remote working style since the pandemic it’s easy to see why 78% of corporates throughout the EU are looking into new technology and platforms to automate their FX operations. Treasury teams may want to do-away with manual processes to minimise errors whilst working remotely
[i]
CFOs should explore centralised, digitised and real-time FX solutions that the team can access and reference.
With US and EU Corporates spending on average over 2 days and on FX-related activities, CFOs can even look to
fully outsource
their FX requirement
[i]
[iii]
This not only frees up capacity and lets the team focus on other issues, but could simultaneously improve the quality of your firm’s FX execution when it's managed by specialists.
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)
81% of treasurers have an ESG policy in place or state that ESG is now being incorporated into decision making
[iv].
ESG is becoming increasing important for corporates forming relationships with external providers. Our recent research revealed that ESG credentials impact selecting FX counterparties in 92% of EU and 97% of US corporates.
[i]
[iii]
Before ESG-linked derivatives go mainstream, CFOs might want to explore forming relationships with banks, and other service providers, who are aligned with their company’s own ESG priorities.
Forming the right relationships
Bank relationship management is central to any businesses achieving their goals and 42% of corporate treasurers are considering bank rationalisation i.e., having fewer bank accounts to help streamline processes
[iv].
CFOs clearly must consider how their external relationships can help them manage FX risk more effectively, but historically this might have meant bringing more banks into the mix rather than fewer.
A possible solution might be to explore multibank execution solutions that offer all the competitive benefits of more banking relationships, without the operational drag.

A common theme in private capital right now is fund managers seeking out opportunities to outsource non-core activities as they build for scale. Even for those processes that would be considered ‘core’, there may also be opportunities to automate, improve efficiency and eradicate operational risk.
For a first-time manager, they might look at FX as a process, from start to finish, that places a disproportionate amount of strain on their finance function.
Fiduciaries must implement a multi- FX counterparty framework that delivers best execution and to get to that point alone can place huge demands on different teams across the business including finance, compliance, legal and, depending on the resources within those business units, the partners.
The obvious question being, shouldn’t the majority of resources be focused on fundraising, deal sourcing and establishing a track record?
For a more well-established manager, they’ve long since overcome these initial hurdles. Although legacy FX infrastructure systems and processes that continue to place skewed demands on the finance team might prevail. My favourite (real life) example is of a private equity manager’s CFO who used to head off to a meeting room with two colleagues every time they needed to book an FX trade. They would each call a different bank to get a quote and then the best quote would win. The team would then head back to their desks to await trade confirmations before arranging settlement, entering and cross-checking payment details, manage regulatory reporting and looping in their fund administrator.
The PE manager wasn’t just bogged down in manual processes, but it also increased the likelihood of errors.
It’s easy to see that similar operating models aren’t sustainable in a flexible working environment which is why digitisation of treasury processes has moved up the ladder of priorities for many fund managers.
A
fund manager
should also consider future-proofing their finance function – in five years' time, there may have been more than two new funds raised, a larger pool of capital and investments to oversee, new strategies, new jurisdictions, new investors and new employees in the team. Archaic processes might be a minor annoyance today but could become a significant operational overhead in the future. As any organisation scales, the bandwidth to make changes diminishes, placing even more importance on selecting service providers today that can grow with your business and who prioritise innovation.
Needs vs Wants
In my opinion, there is only one thing a fund manager must achieve from their FX execution set up and that is
best execution
. In short, this demands that a fiduciary takes all sufficient steps to get the best possible result for their client, and a fund managers clients are their investors. What this looks like in practice however is up for debate, but at the very least a fund manager must have more than one FX counterparty in competition for every trade, and ideally three or more.
However, as any fund manager with an FX exposure will know, the quest for best execution is littered with inefficiencies and ongoing operational drag. From this single regulatory requirement springs a litany of new hurdles and considerations.
Further, many private capital fund managers, particularly those in PE, credit, infrastructure or real estate adopt the same, vanilla hedging strategy.
Whether its share class hedging or a rolling NAV hedge, using quarterly rolls is commonplace, leaving many managers thinking ‘surely this can be automated?’
Setup
The search for eligible FX counterparties might logically start with incumbent banking relationships, and custodians, prime brokers or lenders may be able to offer FX trading services. Where it gets challenging is establishing new relationships for FX only, as there is no guarantee a bank will want to onboard a client that only requires one of their services.
And then there’s the setup phase:
After negotiating the finer points of a non-disclosure agreement, a GP must fill out paperwork, locate and share ‘know-your-customer’ documents and then go through a credit approval process.
Credit approval can be particularly challenging; expect your chosen counterparties to look through investor commitments and underlying assets with a fine-tooth comb.
Respective legal teams will need to work through ISDAs, CSAs and any other trading agreements before setup.
The setup phase places huge demands on internal resources, so the private capital market is moving towards
outsourced solutions
that onboard the fund manager with multiple banking counterparties and also get credit facilities approved with each bank simultaneously.
Price discovery
Once setup is complete, the process of price discovery can happen in a

FX risk management strategies for private equity firms
Private Equity

FX has become a key consideration for many private equity firms. The combination of exposure to foreign currency assets, management fees and investor capital amongst other factors means that many private equity firms may run a high risk of being negatively impacted by currency movements. As a result, we believe private equity firms should prioritise FX risk management to protect their returns.
Here are four of our top tips to help private equity firms strengthen their FX risk management strategy:
1. Transaction Cost Analysis (TCA)
Despite being one of the largest markets in the world, FX is also notoriously one of the most opaque. Transaction costs are hidden in the FX spread, typically calculated as the difference between the traded rate at the point of execution and the mid-market rate at that time.
TCA
was specifically created to highlight hidden costs and enables firms to understand how much they are being charged for the execution of their FX transactions. It can calculate:
The cost on a trade-by-trade basis or the total portfolio cost of a dataset
Cost inconsistencies across product, currency pair, tenor and counterparty
Evidence of best execution.
Ongoing, quarterly
TCA analysis
can also be embedded to ensure consistent FX execution performance.
2. Efficient use of capital
Having the ability to put trades up for competition is typically central to best execution, but FX pricing shouldn’t be the only thing a private equity firm considers.
Private equity firms that hedge using forward contracts, for example, must also consider that placing a hedge typically requires margin to be posted against that position as collateral. Any capital posted as collateral, sitting dormant in a margin account and not invested, potentially earning higher returns, can cause a drag on fund performance. The FX risk, being mitigated with forward contracts, has been replaced with a potential liquidity risk.
One way around this issue is to trade via an uncollateralised FX facility so that a private equity firm can hedge (using forwards) and not worry about posting margin. If the facility is uncollateralised up to a pre-determined figure, there is a cap on how far in the red your mark-to-market can go before your counterparty has no further appetite to trade with you and starts calling for variation margin. This can result in private equity firms spreading trades between different counterparties, with FX rates being a secondary consideration, to keep sufficient headroom on trading facilities and eliminate the need to post margin altogether.
To get set up with an uncollateralised hedging facility, private equity firms can expect to share similar background information to that required for a subscription line. After all, the bank involved will have to cover any negative mark-to-market themselves.
3. Operational Efficiency
For private equity firms, we know that
best execution
requires multiple counterparties, but before price discovery comes the search for eligible FX counterparties. Incumbent banking relationships are the logical place to start, and custodians, prime brokers or lenders may be able to offer FX trading services too. Where it could get challenging is establishing new relationships for FX only, as there is no guarantee a counterparty will want to onboard a client that only requires one of their services.
And then there’s the setup phase. After negotiating the finer points of a non-disclosure agreement, a private equity firm must fill out paperwork, locate and share ‘know-your-customer’ documents and then go through a credit approval process. Respective legal teams will need to work through ISDAs, CSAs and any other trading agreements before setup can even begin.
Once setup is complete, the process of price discovery can happen in several different ways – telephone dealing, onscreen quotes, chat messages and e-mails. With multiple counterparties at a private equity firm’s disposal, it can soon turn into a time-consuming team operation to get the best available price.
For these reasons, the private capital market is moving towards solutions that assist in the onboarding of multiple banking counterparties. Private equity firms might also consider more centralised,
digitised solutions
that consolidate price discovery in one place at one time.
4. Outsourcing
Research published by the investment consultant Russell Investments “
Still Overpaying for FX”
analysed 173,000 FX trades conducted on assets totalling approximately $76 billion.
It concluded that for an average $1 billion fund, savings of $330,000 per annum would have been achievable from the adoption of an agency approach where FX trading is outsourced to a third-party specialist. In some cases, funds could have saved much more.
The Russell study explicitly suggested the consideration of a model whereb

Against a backdrop of
high inflation
,
ongoing supply chain problems
and
rising currency volatility
, corporates have navigated an increasingly difficult landscape over the past twelve months.
These challenges have placed many firms across all sorts of sectors under mounting pressure, and the lessons that businesses learn in stormy seas will often sharpen the focus on how a company’s finance function could evolve during calmer waters.
With several treasurers setting their plans in motion for 2023 and beyond, here we look at how choosing the right foreign exchange (FX) partner can help achieve what many CFOs consider their key strategic priorities.
Navigating an uncertain landscape
The past few years have shown, if anything, the importance of planning for improbable outcomes. Geopolitical events like the invasion of Ukraine, or central bank policy such as rising interest rates, can have a huge impact on currency markets.
If a business finds itself on the wrong side of an FX market move whilst unhedged, it can lead to significant losses.
Despite that, some CFOs still adopt a ‘wait and see’ approach when it comes to currency markets and try to hold out covering their FX exposures until market conditions are more favourable.
This approach, however, holds significant risk in the current volatile landscape. According to
Kyriba’s January 2023 currency impact report
, currency movements cost North American companies $43.15 billion between July to September 2022 — an all-time high since data tracking started a decade ago.
IBM has become the latest big name to highlight the need for an effective hedging strategy, recently reporting that the US dollar’s surge towards the end of last year hurt its revenue by more than
$1 billion
in Q4 2022.
CFOs should aim to ensure they are managing known risks when they can and do away with opportunistic hedging so bottom lines aren’t left exposed to FX market volatility.
Liquidity Management
In tough times liquidity is precious, whether that’s a company's own funds or maintaining sufficient headroom on working capital facilities. According to
Deloitte’s 2022 Global Treasurer survey
, enhancing liquidity risk management is a critical priority for over half of all CFOs.
We believe businesses should explore ways to eliminate unforeseen demands on free cash flow, and one such demand might arise from managing FX risk.
For example, corporates may have to post collateral against FX hedges in the form of initial or variation margin. After posting cash collateral with an FX counterparty this capital is essentially dormant; it isn’t earning a return for the company and can’t be accessed at times when they might need it most.
CFOs should therefore consider seeking hedging solutions that are margin free and don’t pose a threat to cash flow.
Automation and outsourcing
Inadequate treasury systems infrastructure is one of the
top three challenges
faced by many Treasury teams today. This is particularly prominent in FX. According to our
2022 CFO FX survey
, nearly two-thirds (65%) of corporates use manual execution processes, with over a third rating their FX set up as below average or worst in class.
It’s therefore easy to see why
89%
of senior-finance decision makers now looking into new technology and platforms to automate their FX operations.
Unlike manual processes, these solutions can streamline the end-to-end workflow, heighten transparency and enable many firms to get the best possible rates.
CFOs can even look to fully outsource their FX requirement. According to
HSBC and Acuris
, 44% of CFOs in larger companies (with revenues over $5bn) have outsourced some of their day-to-day functions.
Harnessing external solutions may
ease the administrative burden of onboarding new FX counterparties
centralising price discovery
navigating the post-execution phase, whilst also freeing up resources for more effective use elsewhere.
The end product is also more likely to be of higher quality, leading to improved execution.
ESG
According to
EY
, more than three-quarters of investors think that companies should make investments that address ESG issues relevant to their business, even if it reduces profits in the short term.
Similarly,
60%
of corporate treasurers believe that ESG criteria will have a significant impact on treasury organisations and processes.
ESG-linked FX derivatives are in their infancy, with only a handful of examples cited in
ISDA’s 2021 report
‘Overview of ESG-related derivatives, products and transactions’. However, we believe CFOs should expect these kinds of structures to become more common.
Before ESG-linked derivatives go mainstream, CFOs might want to explore forming relationships with banks, and other service providers, that are aligned with their c

Traditional FX risk management processes are often manual, time-consuming and reliant on outdated tools—making it harder for corporates to respond quickly and efficiently in today’s volatile markets. It’s little wonder, then, that all respondents in our recent
North American
and
UK corporate
FX surveys said they are exploring the use of AI in some capacity to improve both operations and decision-making.
In this blog, we take a closer look at how corporates across both regions are starting to adopt AI to reduce their reliance on resource-heavy manual tasks, and move towards more intelligent, tech-driven FX solutions.
AI as a strategic tool for FX risk management
AI is rapidly becoming a strategic priority for corporates on both sides of the Atlantic—especially as firms search for smarter ways to navigate currency volatility. Faced with ongoing
geopolitical tensions
,
diverging monetary policies
and a backdrop of
macroeconomic challenges
, FX risk management is naturally emerging as a key area of interest for innovative technologies.
Corporates are beginning to take action:
46%
of firms in North America are exploring how AI could help them
anticipate and manage FX risk
.
43%
of UK corporates report a similar level of interest in using
AI for FX management
.
While these numbers reflect consideration rather than full-scale adoption, they signal a clear shift: AI is moving from theory to strategy in the world of corporate treasury.
Commenting on the trend,
Sam Hunt, CTO at MillTech
, affirms:
“The genie is well and truly out of the bottle with generative AI and any organisation not thinking about how this technology can enhance their offering risks being left behind. It’s clear from the findings that CFOs realise that in today’s fast-paced digital landscape, embracing AI-driven innovation is no longer optional but essential for staying competitive.”
Early-stage exploration beyond risk management
Building on this momentum, process automation and FX operations are also emerging as key areas of AI exploration among corporates in both North America and the UK:
39%
of North American corporates and
41%
of UK corporates are investigating how AI can
streamline internal processes
and
drive greater operational efficiency
.
36%
in North America and
42%
in the UK are focusing on applying AI within FX operations to
reduce their reliance on manual procedures
.
35%
of corporates in North America and
26%
in the UK are exploring AI to
enhance trade execution
, highlighting its growing potential to improve the speed, accuracy and consistency of FX transactions.
Together, these trends point to a broader shift: corporates are not only recognising the strategic value of AI, but actively seeking ways to embed it across their FX management strategy.
AI use cases in FX
According to
Justin Xu, Head of Quant and AI Strategy at MillTech
, AI is unlocking new levels of precision and control in currency management.
Predictive analytics for FX risk management
Machine learning algorithms analyse diverse source of information, including historical price movements, macroeconomic indicators, and central bank policies, to predict the direction and magnitude of currency market risks. These insights enable CFOs and treasurers to make more informed hedging decisions, minimizing exposure to currency risk.
Natural language processing (NLP) for sentiment analysis
NLP-powered AI models process news articles, central bank statements, and social media sentiment to assess market conditions. By extracting insights from both structured and unstructured data sources, corporates can more effectively manage event-related currency risks, thereby gaining a competitive edge in FX risk management decisions.
AI-powered process automation
Many FX-related tasks, such as trade reconciliation, compliance reporting, and KYC/AML processes, are time-consuming and prone to human error. AI-driven automation tools can help to streamline these workflows, reducing manual effort and improving accuracy.
Looking ahead: What's shaping the future of FX?
When it comes to the future of FX operations, corporates on both sides of the Atlantic are placing their bets on emerging technologies—but not always in the same order.
In North America, corporates are most optimistic about the impact of automation and data-driven tools, with notable interest in several other technologies:
Automation and Big Data analytics were each chosen by
26%
as the most impactful technologies over the next five years.
18%
expect
quantum computing
to play a significant role.
16%
point to
AI
as a transformative force.
In the UK, corporates are leaning more heavily into blockchain and AI-led transformation:
23%
cite
blockchain
as the most influential technology on the horizon.
21%
highlight
automation tools
as a priority.

Breaking down FX trends: What’s next for Swiss funds?

Switzerland is more than just breathtaking alpine views and luxury watches—it’s a financial powerhouse with a unique flair for attracting investors. Known for its stability, the Swiss franc (CHF) has earned a reputation as a safe haven during shaky global times. But even the Swiss economy isn’t immune to volatility, as proved in 2024.
The Swiss National Bank (SNB) turned heads early in the year when it became the first major economy to cut rates. In March, the SNB trimmed its policy rate by
25 basis points to 1.5%
, despite inflation being under control. By December, the SNB doubled down with a , aiming to boost the economy further—a move bound to spark debate.
So, how are Swiss fund managers navigating this shifting monetary landscape? Our newdives into the innovative strategies they’re using to hedge against market uncertainty. From adapting to economic changes to cutting back on outdated manual processes that devoured time and resources in 2023.
Curious? Let’s take a closer look at the Swiss FX landscape.
From hesitation to adoption: The evolution of hedging strategies
In 2023 94% of Swiss fund managers took proactive steps to hedge against forecastable currency risk, even those who initially chose not to, began reconsidering their stance. Fast forward to 2024, and every single respondent had embraced hedging strategies. Let’s dig deeper…
The hedge game is changing, and fund managers are stepping up their strategy. In 2024, Swiss fund managers made a powerful pivot, adopting long hedge strategies that had previously been shunned. 7 in 10 now hedge 51-75% of their exposure—a striking move that echoes the 78% who hinted at ramping up hedge ratios back in 2023.
In 2024, a whopping 70% of fund managers were locking in hedges 4-6 months ahead—a dramatic leap from just 16% the year before, when most played it safe with shorter 1-3 month windows. Now? They're looking even further ahead, with another bold 70% gearing up to extend their hedge durations even more.
Is this confidence in the face of uncertainty or calculated caution? Either way, it’s a shift that speaks volumes. Fund managers are moving beyond avoiding market volatility, focusing on smarter hedging strategies and preparing to navigate the unpredictable financial landscape.
When markets tremble: How the Credit Suisse collapse reshaped liquidity
The
2023 Credit Suisse collapse
sent shockwaves through global markets, prompting Swiss regulators to strengthen liquidity rules to safeguard financial stability.
Authorities tightened oversight and introduced enhanced capital requirements
, taking effect in 2024. One standout move? Switzerland's financial regulator FINMA, now has the authority to hit banks with custom surcharges, ensuring they meet higher liquidity standards. Unsurprisingly, 70% of fund managers reported in 2024, credit providers had clamped down on lending criteria, making funding harder to secure.
50% of fund managers reported credit providers are slashing fees despite liquidity challenges. With lower interest rates comes fierce competition, consequently banks are likely cutting lending costs for those deemed creditworthy borrowers. A tale of two strategies.
Saving time: Automating the chaos of manual processes
Manual processes have long been the arch-nemesis of fund managers—tedious, time-draining, and a serious manpower hog. In 2023, a staggering 84% of fund managers admitted to spending 2-3 days wrestling with FX tasks, and an unlucky 13% were stuck dealing it for as long as 4-5 workdays. With groundbreaking tech available to slash this workload, why are so many fund managers still stuck in the pit of manual processes?
It turns out that manual processes are not only still troubling many fund managers but are also becoming more widespread. 60% of Swiss fund managers now cite manual challenges as their biggest obstacle, a significant jump from 38% in 2023. But there’s hope on the horizon. The tide is turning, with 6 in 10 fund managers now embracing APIs to handle FX transactions. What’s driving this shift? The new T+1 settlement cycle might just be the nudge fund managers needed to finally upgrade their technology, with 60% upgrading to meet the reduced settlement demand.
The message is clear: the days of clunky, time-wasting processes are numbered. As technology sweeps through the industry, Swiss fund managers are starting to trade their old habits for faster, smarter solutions.
Half of asset managers surveyed are now outsourcing their FX operations to enhance , whilst 7 in 10 are now considering automating trade execution and risk identification. Only time will tell, who’s prepared to embrace this wave of change—and who’ll get left behind?

Top 3 FX challenges facing UK fund managers

Many fund managers treat FX like people treat dentistry. When there are no signs of pain, it’s not a priority – but when the pain starts, it quickly becomes an emergency.
FX can make or break fund managers’ returns and have a serious impact on operational costs. In this blog post, we’ll discuss the top three FX challenges UK fund managers are currently dealing with, as revealed by
our latest research
, along with strategies to address them.
1.     Cost calculation – 37%
In the world of fund management, calculating the costs associated with FX transactions remains the most significant challenge for fund managers, with 37% identifying it as an issue, an increase from
33% in 2023
.
Managing multi-currency portfolios often means handling complex FX conversions, where minute discrepancies in rates can compound significantly over time, eroding overall returns. Unlike other cost elements that are more straightforward, FX costs are inherently dynamic, influenced by volatile currency movements and variable transaction fees.
This unpredictability means that fund managers are constantly seeking ways to more accurately forecast and control FX expenses to maintain their portfolios’ performance.
The calculation of FX costs is made more challenging by the absence of standardised practices in the industry. Many fund managers rely on multiple liquidity partners, each with unique pricing models, spread markups and fee structures. The lack of transparency in these FX markups can make it difficult for fund managers to understand the true cost of their FX transactions.
So what is the solution?
One possible approach is to implement a comprehensive FX risk management strategy, comprising regular reviews and comparisons of the pricing structures offered by different liquidity providers. This can help fund managers identify potential cost savings opportunities and negotiate better rates. Some solutions can provide fund managers with access to a
multi-bank FX platform
, allowing them to compare live rates from multiple tier-1 liquidity partners, ensuring they gain full transparency on FX costs and helping them to achieve best execution.
Leveraging technology also enables fund managers to automate key FX processes, create detailed reports and analyses of past transactions, and identify patterns and trends in their FX costs.
For example, an independent
transaction cost analysis
(TCA) can allow fund managers to assess the true cost of their FX trades by revealing hidden costs in the spread and evaluate their execution quality against market benchmarks, helping to drive more informed decision-making.
2.     Reliance on manual processes - 36%
Many fund managers continue to rely on outdated, manual processes for instructing FX transactions, with phone calls and emails remaining the primary methods among UK fund managers. In fact, 77% still depend on these traditional approaches to execute transactions. In North America, fund managers have
adopted more modern solutions
, with APIs (32%) and web apps (30%) being the most popular methods to transact, leaving only 50% still using phones or emails.
Operating FX processes via these manual processes is a huge drain on efficiency and can take up a significant portion of funds’ manpower and time. It makes no sense to operate with these processes when far more modern alternatives exist. It’s the equivalent of sending someone a message via fax in this day and age, rather than a simple text message.
Managing manual processes has been highlighted as a key challenge for UK fund managers in 2024, with 36% reporting it to be a critical issue. However, this appears to be a particularly persistent challenge, with 39% saying this was an issue in 2023.
Smaller funds (£40-80 million assets under management) also relied more heavily on manual processes than larger funds (£9-16 billion AUM), with 38% instructing over email and 44% over the phone, in comparison to 21% and 36% respectively. This underscores a major gap between smaller and larger funds in adopting automation technology for their FX processes, likely due to limited resources, expertise and tighter budgets, creating constraints on investing in such technology.
For those looking for alternatives, they may find solutions in the below:
API’s (31%):
APIs serve as bridges, enabling different software systems to communicate and in turn exchange data. Leveraging APIs for FX transactions allows businesses to automate trade execution by integrating an FX platform into their own systems.
Online User interface (28%):
3rd Party Web Apps, are software applications, designed and built by 3rd parties, accessed through a web browser.
Instructing via your own IT system (26%)
3.     Onboarding new liquidity providers - 34%
The onboarding process for new liquidity partners is often still ou

How the travel industry can adapt to mounting FX challenges

According to the
World Tourism Organisation
, international travel plunged by 72% in 2020 - the worst year on record - causing the global tourism and travel sector an estimated
$2 trillion in lost revenue in 2021
.
While travel is gradually
climbing back to pre-pandemic levels
, inflationary pressures are hampering its recovery and it’s predicted that the industry won’t fully recovery until
2024
.
Amongst the growing number of challenges facing these firms is the threat of adverse currency movements. Their overseas exposure makes them highly susceptible to fluctuations in foreign exchange (FX) rates, but many may have traditionally seen FX as second order. They transact in FX not because they ‘want to’, but because they ‘have to’ given their international nature.
We believe that now is the time for travel companies to assess the FX challenges they typically face and implement effective risk management strategies against these threats.
What are the FX challenges?
Travel companies face several challenges on the FX front:
International service chain –
They are particularly exposed to currency movements due to the international distribution of the tourism service chain. Tour operators, hotel chains and transport providers may all be based in different countries and therefore require payments in multiple currencies, heightening exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates.
Long invoice processing periods –
When selling customers tours or flights, destination management companies and travel agencies often set their price well ahead of time, sometimes up to 18 months ahead. This means that if currencies fluctuate between a customer’s advance payment and the moment foreign suppliers need to be paid, the travel company may find itself having to cover the difference.
Visitor-weighted exchange –
Visitor weighted-exchange measures a destination’s currency market with those of its primary visitor market. Countries that rely on a large proportion of tourists coming from one specific country are susceptible to changes in the exchange rate between these two countries. In Mexico, for example, the World Travel and Tourism Council estimates that
84%
of international arrivals come from countries using the US dollar. This means where the visitor-weighted exchange is high, fluctuations in exchange rate may have a particularly large impact on the destination country’s travel sector.
A more strategic approach to FX risk management
Whilst FX management cannot change the external environment, there are several steps that travel companies can take to reduce the associated costs and minimise volatility risk. These include:
1. Use of Transaction Cost Analysis (TCA) -
TCA was specifically created to highlight hidden costs and enables firms to understand how much they are being charged for the execution of their FX transactions. Ongoing, quarterly TCA from an independent TCA provider can be embedded as a new operational practice to ensure consistent FX execution performance.
2. Compare the market -
Many travel firms may be hampered by their inability to access Tier 1 FX liquidity, meaning they often rely on a single bank or broker to meet their hedging requirements which can be a barrier to best execution. Having the ability to put trades up for competition is central to ensuring access to the best price, which is key to effective risk management.
3. Outsourcing –
When using the right partner, outsourcing can improve transparency and execution quality. This can enable travel firms to dedicate more time to core business matters, which is all the more important given the current
high operating costs
.
4. Strong governance –
The tourism service chain can be logistically complex, from tour operators to accommodation and transport providers, with each potentially requiring payment in different currencies. Harnessing solutions which can strengthen governance may help travel firms improve the cost, quality and transparency of their FX execution.
5. Diversification of liquidity providers -
One of the big lessons from recent banking failures is the importance of having access to multiple counterparties. Many CFOs have taken this lesson onboard and are now making changes for the better, with
88%
exploring diversifying their FX across more counterparties. This means if one counterparty becomes unavailable, a travel company can continue to manage and execute FX trades.
6. Automation –
Many travel firms may still lack the necessary tools to mitigate the impact of FX volatility and continue to rely on manual processes like phone and email to execute FX trades. Harnessing automated solutions can offer end to end workflow, greater transparency and faster onboarding, helping finance departments streamline their FX functions.

## How Private Equity firms are tackling FX risk

How Private Equity firms are tackling FX risk
Private Equity

Updated:
23 April 2025
Against a backdrop of
high inflation
,
currency volatility
and
well-documented economic uncertainty
, we believe private equity firms should prioritise FX risk management to improve performance, deliver sustainable growth and, ultimately, protect their returns.
Despite the rising importance of FX for private equity firms, many suffer from a lack of transparency across fees, as well as barriers to best execution due to improper infrastructure and cumbersome legacy processes.
Here are some of the top challenges that private equity firms face when it comes to managing their FX risk:
Maintaining transparency of FX costs
Managing FX costs
Monitoring FX costs
1. Maintaining transparency of FX costs
Fund managers may often be spoiled for choice when weighing up service providers such as banking partners, subscription line lenders and fund administrators, meaning decisions are often made on fine margins.
Unnecessary costs should be avoided because investors expect that every single pound, euro or dollar generates a return and partners are aiming to surpass their performance hurdle.
Both investors and partners have significant skin in the game, so when they kick the tyres and look under the bonnet of the finance function, they might expect a rigorous audit trail of how costs are being managed and objective decisions are made.
This seems straightforward enough, but it turns out but it turns out that less than
30%
of investors have a view of their total FX costs.
2. Managing FX costs
Private equity firms have a fiduciary responsibility to pursue best execution for their clients, so we believe they should have
multiple FX counterparties
at their disposal every time they enter the market to execute a trade.
As well as having multiple FX providers, fund managers might also want to consider if the financial stability and credit ratings of their chosen counterparties is sufficient. When a fund manager implements an FX policy, we believe they should also consider the following:
If notional / credit thresholds are of sufficient size
The credit terms of the facility are in line with their liquidity profile
If trade tenors match their desired hedging strategy
Many CFOs and COOs can articulate their FX strategy, best performing counterparties and associated credit limits, but few may struggle to say with certainty what their costs are explicitly, and relative to what may have been agreed upfront.
FX costs are usually hidden as an all-in rate which is discounted from the mid. However, it can be hard for fund managers at private equity firms to identify where the mid is and therefore calculate what their costs are on a trade-by-trade basis.
3. Monitoring FX costs
Fund managers at private equity firms can always check what they’re being charged on FX transactions by conducting regular
transaction cost analysis (TCA)
.
TCA goes hand-in-hand with
best execution
and can be used as an ongoing audit of FX practices as well as hold existing FX counterparties to account.
One major goal of TCA is to gain oversight of trading costs, but additionally it helps to comply with best execution policy, regulation and strong governance expectations from investors and internal stakeholders.
Private equity firms can implement TCA as part of a broader process of monitoring FX costs which includes:
Finding FX counterparties that can meet your requirements
Comparing pricing on a trade-by-trade basis
Capturing trade data for regular, post-execution cost analysis i.e. TCA
However, these straightforward steps are often overlooked.
A recent survey titled
‘The Grey Costs of FX’
drew feedback from various FX industry specialists – 45% were investors, 25% asset owners and 20% either banks or brokers. It found that 39% of the industry is not tracking any TCA for FX.
This is because many private equity firms may still use manual processes to compare pricing, execute trades, and reconcile trade information - namely trade timestamps - which are sometimes not reported accurately by their FX counterparties.
Moreover, for many fund managers at private equity firms, FX is a non-core business activity. This means they commonly get set up with a handful of FX counterparties, with the hope that increased competition bypasses the need to agree upfront costs and monitor them on an ongoing basis.

23 April 2025
The foreign exchange (FX) market is one of the largest and most liquid in the world, with a daily volume of
$6.6 trillion
. A combination of high inflation, geo-political uncertainty and currency volatility over the past twelve months has placed the importance of having a FX strategy firmly back in the spotlight.
Despite this significant risk, many private equity (PE) firms with currency exposures have given FX policy very little consideration. However, with
currency volatility
set to persist throughout the remainder of 2023, it is vital that PE firms are aware of how currency fluctuations may impact their returns.
Here are four key ways in which private equity firms might find themselves exposed to FX risk:
Foreign currency assets
Impact of FX rate movements on management fees
Investor Capital
Indirect, portfolio level FX exposure
1. Foreign currency assets
The more jurisdictions a PE managers’ strategy allows for, the greater the number of investment opportunities. But, given that annual movements in even
G10 currency pairs
can be significant, FX rate movements have the potential to erode long-term value creation efforts or create complications pre-acquisition and pre-disposal.
PE managers commonly implement short-dated hedging to lock in rates during the purchase or sale of an asset, whilst others may even consider hedging asset value throughout the entire hold period.
2.
Impact of FX rate movements on management fees
It is not uncommon to see PE managers raise a fund in one currency but have offices outside the jurisdiction of their fund’s base currency.
This means the PE manager receives their management fees in one currency but then has to pay for certain fixed costs, such as salaries and offices, in one or potentially multiple different currencies.
FX rate movements can place a greater strain on management fee income and for that reason PE managers commonly look to lock in exchange rates on expected fee income for as long as possible.
3. Investor Capital
As a PE manager matures, it becomes increasingly likely that they may see foreign currency investors commit capital to their funds. Some managers may take the stance of letting their investors manage their own FX risk, whilst others may implement share class hedging.
Share class hedging mitigates FX risk when investors are considering which funds to commit to and, in that way, can be a useful tool for managers to broaden their investor base and make their funds more marketable overseas.
4. Indirect, portfolio level FX exposure
As a PE manager grows its portfolio, their investment team may have to overhaul how their portfolio businesses manage their FX exposure.
Our own 2023 fund managers FX survey found that 80% of UK and 82% of EU fund managers have looked to diversify FX counterparties since the recent banking crisis, with 87% of those in the EU exploring new technology and platforms to automate their FX operations.
A PE firm may look to align their own set-up and processes with those of their underlying portfolio and hold them to the same high governance standards.

Belgian Fund Managers’ approach to managing FX volatility

Having operated using the Belgian Franc since as far back as 1832, Belgium made the decision to
adopt the euro upon its launch in 2002
.
Belgium's contribution to the European Union cannot be understated, and it is often named ‘the heart of Europe’ with good reason. Home to the European Parliament, European Council and European Commission,
Belgium was a key player
in establishing the European Coal and Steel Community and the European Economic Community. These organisations went on to become the European Union we know today.
It therefore comes as no surprise that Belgium is heavily reliant on and invested in the value of the euro, and has experienced the currency’s highs and lows, including the value height of
1.6 EUR
to 1 USD in 2008 and its gradual decline to
roughly 1.1 EUR to the
dollar today.
Despite its core role within the EU, Belgium maintains strong trade figures with the rest of the world, with
43.1% of imports and 32%
of exports derived from outside of the Union. This makes foreign exchange a key element of the Belgian economy. The country also comes
sixth in the EU in terms of GDP per capita
, and accounts for 3.4% of the Union’s total GDP, making it a key business, trade and finance centre.
MillTech recently surveyed 250 senior finance decision-makers at fund managers across Europe to gain insight into how different countries operate FX resourcing, risk management and hedging strategies.
The report shows us that FX management is high on the priority list for fund managers in Belgium. This blog delves into the research’s insights into Belgian fund managers’ FX risk management, including their FX exposure, pain points, hedging strategies and priorities.
In this blog:
The importance of FX to fund managers in Belgium
Reliance on manual processes and appetite for automation
Belgium fund managers struggle with a lack of FX transparency
Hedging trends in Belgium
Belgium's need to diversify FX counterparties
ESG priorities in Belgium
FX should be a key priority for Belgium's fund managers in 2024
The importance of FX to fund managers in Belgium
The MillTech European Fund Manager CFO FX Report 2024 found that:
90% of fund managers in Belgium said that FX was significant to their business, higher than the European average of 88%.
Belgium also had the second highest percentage of fund managers that said FX was very significant to their business (32%).
The report also found that 74% of fund managers in Belgium said their returns had been affected by EUR volatility, lower than the European average of 89%.
Interestingly, 57% of Belgian fund managers’ business activity is exposed to foreign currency risk. This was the second highest of any European country surveyed, behind Luxembourg (60%), and higher than the average of 51%, demonstrating the importance of FX to fund managers in the country.
Reliance on manual processes and appetite for automation
Belgium still has work to do when it comes to embracing FX automation and its fund managers are still dependent on outdated manual processes that significantly reduce efficiency.
An average of 2.3 days a week are spent on FX-related activities by fund managers in Belgium, slightly below the European average of 2.61 days.
However, Belgium was found to have the highest number of team members tasked with FX-related activities (3.1), more than the European average of 2.8.
Belgium’s fund managers were also found to have an above-average reliance on some manual processes, with 35% using phones to instruct financial transactions. Such manual processes are a burden on human capital for fund managers and significantly reduce the efficiency of foreign exchange activity.
However, the report did find the country to have the lowest usage of email - o
nly 29% compared to an average of 43%.
This, on top of the fact that 84% of Belgian fund managers are exploring new technology to automate FX operations, shows that the industry is moving in the right direction towards increased efficiency.
Belgian fund managers struggle with a lack of FX transparency
Nearly four-fifths (77%) of Belgian fund managers said there is a lack of transparency in the FX market.
This proportion was lower than the European average of 82%, but still showed transparency to be a highly significant issue.
Hedging trends in Belgium
Although 74% of Belgian fund managers said their returns had been impacted by EUR volatility, the country had one of the lowest proportions of fund managers that hedge their forecastable currency risk (71%), below the European average of 77%.
That said, 89% of unhedged fund managers in Belgium are now considering hedging due to market volatility, broadly in line with the average of 88%.
Belgium also has the highest percentage of fund managers that hedge all or a large proportion of their FX exposure - 91%.

Learn the Basics of FX
The foreign exchange (FX) market is the largest financial market in the world with a daily trading volume of $6.6 trillion.
Despite its size, the opaque nature of FX places great responsibility on asset managers and corporates to put the processes, practices and systems in place to ensure the best result possible.
While the market has a wide range of providers offering a vast array of services, we believe that the FX market isn’t fit for purpose for many asset managers and corporates. For too long they have been unable to access rates from multiple providers and suffered the consequences of hidden charges and a lack of visibility on whether they are getting a good deal.

MillTechFX CFO FX Report 2022 - The intensifying FX challenges for Fund Managers
Volatility has dominated the foreign exchange (FX) market so far in 2022, driven by high inflation, rising interest rates and geopolitical issues. The FX challenges for CFOs are intensifying with the rising threat of currency movements negatively impacting their investment returns. A series of market-moving events in recent years has placed the importance of having a FX strategy firmly back in the spotlight. However, many fund managers have traditionally struggled with a number of issues when it comes to their FX setup.
With this in mind, Censuswide conducted a survey on MillTechFX’s behalf of 250 senior finance decision-makers at fund managers to review where they are on their FX journey and where they would like to get to. The ‘MillTechFX FX Survey 2022: The intensifying FX challenges for fund managers’ explores how important FX is for fund managers, how much resource they dedicate to FX, challenges they face and solutions they are exploring.

Navigating the opaque but evolving world of FX execution
A series of market-moving events in recent years has placed the importance of having a FX strategy firmly back in the spotlight. It would be easy to think that these are one-off events, that geopolitical uncertainty and currency volatility will calm down. But, in fact, FX volatility is a constant.
Despite this significant risk, many private equity firms with currency exposures have given FX policy very little consideration. And those that have might still suffer from a lack of transparency when it comes to fees, as well as from improper infrastructure for best execution.
This paper is designed to highlight the importance of FX to private equity firms, shine a light on the issues they face in achieving best execution and provide them with practical steps to improve their FX processes and reduce their costs.

The Fund Manager's Guide to FX-as-a-Service
A common theme in private capital right now is fund managers seeking out opportunities to outsource non-core activities as they build for scale. Even for those processes that would be considered ‘core’, there may also be opportunities to automate, improve efficiency and eradicate operational risk.
For a first-time manager, they might look at FX as a process, from start to finish, that places a disproportionate amount of strain on their finance function.
Fiduciaries must implement a multi- FX counterparty framework that delivers best execution and to get to that point alone can place huge demands on different teams across the business including finance, compliance, legal and, depending on the resources within those business units, the partners.
The obvious question being, shouldn’t the majority of resources be focused on fundraising, deal sourcing and establishing a track record?

A Guide to Currency Issues for UK Institutional Investors
Institutional investors are progressively increasing their exposure to foreign assets in order to diversify their portfolios and gain access to new opportunities for higher returns.
Currency exposures are an unavoidable part of that process. Today, for most institutional portfolios, currencies are the second highest contributor to risk in the total portfolio behind equities.
Currency risk matters – and its impact is too big to be ignored.
